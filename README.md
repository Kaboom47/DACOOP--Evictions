# DACOOP--Evictions
We used Excel, Tableau, SQL, Google Sheets, and Google Slides to present our findings on Evictions in NYC

I was the Project Manager for this assignment, I was the main POC (Point of Contact) with our client, who was a Captain/Manager who we reported to about this project for NYCHA.

Our client is  NYC Housing Authority.
In New York State, an eviction of a tenant is lawful only if an owner has brought a court proceeding and obtained a judgment of possession from the court.
The pandemic started on January 10, 2020 and we wanted to take a closer look on how that impacted NYC on evictions


Assisted Data Analyst I worked with figure out how to present their data and what would be the best way to illustrate our findings to the client.
Helped with SQL Querys to Pull Data from the Database to pull out insights,
Encouraged the use of Tableau to help grab charts and visualizations that were best suited to explaining our team's findings.
Made Sure to assist the Team with Excel Pivot Tables & XLOOKUP for question-specific answers.
